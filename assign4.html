    <h1>Monetization</h2>
    <p1>The webiste offers the service of verifitcation, and there are two
        choices for users to choose. The first one is photo verfication, which
        users can upload their photos directly. The second one is object verificaiton,
        and the users need to deliver their jerseys to us. Most participants of 
        usability test would choose the first method because they think this way
        is more convinient and the price is lower. Absolutely, object verfication is more
        expensive than the photo verfication.
