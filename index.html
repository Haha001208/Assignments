            <p>This is my first assignment, and I like soccer. Therefore, I choose
                the soccer field as my background image. Paulinho is my favorite soccer
                player, and I have put his photo beside the text. He played in Barcelona
                soccer club before, which is also a successful club in the world. I knew him
                after he came to Guangzhou, and played as a midfileder in Guangzhou Evergrande.
                He also joined the World Cup many times with his Brazilian team members. Paulinho
                got many champions in his career, such as: AFC, Spainish League Title.
